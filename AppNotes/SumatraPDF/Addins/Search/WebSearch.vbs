' Script template to paste selected word(s) into a chosen browser search
' Expects a word or more has been selected e.g. double click will select that word
' For multiple words you will need to overstrike, right click, and copy selection.
'
' Usage:- Add to SumatraPdf-settings.txt replacing / adding to existing entry (remove the ' comment marks)

'		Name = &Browser Search
'		Filter = *.*
'	  ]
' ]
'
' NOTE unlike other addins where the %addins% environment setting is supplied via cmd
' in this case wscript does not understand that value so you will need to edit the
' %addins% part to suit the location of this file in your system (but then not easily portable).
'
' The portable way is to use cmd.exe to call wscript but then you get the usual console Black Flash.
' CommandLine = c:\windows\system32\cmd.exe /d /c "Mode 15,1 & wscript.exe %Addins%\Search\WebSearch.vbs " <
' The Black Flash is minimised with "Mode 15,1 &". It also helps if your browser is active minimised.
'
' Also change the sections below to suit your browser preferences.
' When added as above then you should be able to select some text e.g. double click
' a word then use shortcut ALT+F+B or file menu item "Open in Browser Search"
