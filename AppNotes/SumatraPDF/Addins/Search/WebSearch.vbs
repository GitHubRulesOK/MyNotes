' NOTE unlike other addins where the %addins% environment setting is supplied via cmd
' in this case wscript does not understand the value so you will need to edit the
' %addins% part to suit the location of this file in your system (not easily portable).
' the portable way is to use cmd.exe to call wscript but then you get the usual Black Flash.
