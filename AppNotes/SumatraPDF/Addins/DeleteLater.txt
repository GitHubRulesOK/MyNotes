From a question on GitHub (https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/633)
From a Request/Suggestion by Marmotian (https://github.com/Marmotian)

Whilst viewing files in SumatraPDf some files can easily be deleted using CTRL + F + F + DEL

However in many cases the files are "File Locked" by the windows system as "Open for reading".

In these cases it is useful if the filename can be stored such as it can be deleted later
e.g. when the viewing session is ended.
One simple way is to export the currently viewed filename using ExternalViewers

ExternalViewers [
  [
    CommandLine = c:\windows\system32\cmd.exe /d /c "echo @del /p "%1" >>%UserProfile%\desktop\DeleteMeList.cmd"
    Name = Delete File &Later (after all are closed)
    Filter = *.*
  ]
]

If you paste the above section into SumatraPDF-settings.txt (Settings > Advanced Options)
You can use the shortcut ALT + F + L to invoke for the currently viewed file

IF you dont want the normal Console Black Flash then you would need to switch to a more complex wscript one liner (any takers ?).
