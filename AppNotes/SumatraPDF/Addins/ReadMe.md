Overview
--------

These "Addins" script files are intended to be used in a subfolder below the location of SumatraPDF. \
Unlike plugins that are preloaded and occupy resources these files are expected to be used "on demand". \
They are written to be used independently and many can also be used as external standalone apps. \
Since file types are often executable e.g. a.cmd they may often be flagged as viral "False Positive's". \
You can read them as plain text and download with a .txt extension then once happy the content is not harmful rename them to .cmd

Some Addins are so small they don't need a file of their own but are written with a description so you can cut and paste them into other files.
