# Whilst viewing files in SumatraPDf some additional options may be visible in
# the File Menu, so whilst viewing a PDF you may see Open in Adobe Reader or for
# a CHM Open in Microsoft HTML Help, they are auto-detected by SumatraPDF and
# added as viable installed ExternalViewer options. Others may include Foxit
# (Phantom) and Tracker PDF-XChange (Editor/Viewer)

# However in some cases an installed option may be missing an unusual install
# or windows support may have changed, such as removing xps viewer.

# In these cases it is possible to manually "add your own" using "ExternalViewers"
# So a notable choice may be to "Open in Edge". So here I list some I like to add.

ExternalViewers [

# This first one is not much use, it is here to show what happens if you add a

# Note: recent Win10 if the built in xps viewer wasn't installed with a system
# refresh may need "manage optional features" then " add a feature" XPS Viewer
